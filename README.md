# ❄️ WhiteMatter – Optimizing Artificial Snow Production with Nucleating Agents

**WhiteMatter** is an interactive Streamlit application designed to help ski resorts analyze and optimize the efficiency of artificial snow production. The tool compares resource usage and operational costs **with and without the use of nucleating agents**, based on scientifically grounded climate scenarios and user-defined parameters such as slope area, snow depth, and energy prices.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Simulation of **snow, water, and energy demand** over customizable time periods and ski area sizes  
- Dynamic calculation of **cost savings from using nucleating agents**  
- Fully adjustable input parameters (e.g., energy cost, water usage, climate scenario)  
- Clear visualizations of **potential savings** in both percentages and absolute values  
- Expandable section with detailed **explanations of all calculations**

## 🎯 Objective

This application supports decision-makers in alpine regions by offering a transparent and flexible tool for **sustainable snow management** – both economically and ecologically.
